# Three Dimensional Source Localization
Using Q-Learning to Train RL Agent for source localization


## DATA
Currently the data is denerated from a point source and then a gradient if formed around the source. Future work includes integrating real world data.


All mass spec data files are formatted as follows: The format of longitude and latitude in decimal degrees, depth in meters, methane in micromole per kilogram, methane_ppmv in parts per million by volume (ppmv), nitrogen in micromole per kilogram, oxygen in in micromole per kilogram and carbon dioxide in micromole per kilogram.
